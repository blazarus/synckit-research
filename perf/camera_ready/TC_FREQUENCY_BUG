For the techcrunch tests, we label frequencies as .008 client checks/server
update or 4 client checks/server update.  This was based on a server update
rate of one post every 120 minutes.  In truth, the update value was one
post every 114 minutes.

So in fact, all frequencies should be divided by 12 (the almost true number
of server updates per day based on one update/2 hours) and multiplied by
12.631578947 (the true value based on one update/114 minutes).

So Freq 4 checks/update = (4*12)/12.631578947 = 3.8.
