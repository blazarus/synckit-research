The synckit rates and bandwidths are adjusted by the values in
wiki-server-synckit-cacherate.txt.

Whatever httperf shows as the requests/second doesn't include the local
cache hits, so
adjusted RPS = reported RPS / (1-hit rate)

Whatever httperf shows as bytes/request is an average, but in expectation,
we will see:
bytes per request = reported bpr*(1-hit rate) + 0*( hit rate)
