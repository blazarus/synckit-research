The pages

- blog.php
- blog-flying.php
- wiki.php
- wiki-flying.php

Are the files to be maintained for the blog and wiki tests. These contain the
test code and links to include the synckit files. When you are ready to test, 
just run:

php blog.php > blog.html

Or the equivalent for each file. The resulting HTML file is the one that should
be used during testing.
